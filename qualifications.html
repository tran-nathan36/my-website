          <h2>Technical Areas of Interest</h2>
          <div>
            My technical areas of interest in the field of Computer Science are AI and Machine Learning. With AI becoming increasingly prominent in the current age, I have been very interested in the possible roles and applications of AI in everyday life especially when the possible applications are so broad. AI now ranges from learning models, to image generators like DALLE. I hope to be able to leave my own contribution in this field and help refine AI for the applications we have currently or maybe even work on an application that we have not even thought of or is in early development.
