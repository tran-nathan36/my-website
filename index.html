            <p>Hello, welcome to my personal webpage! My name is Nathan Tran. What you are looking at now is a web page created in order to showcase a little about me and my involvement in the field of computer science including my experience and what I hope to do with computer science in the future as well as a little bit of my interests and how they tie back to what I hope to do.</p>
            <p>I am currently a junior student at Texas A&M University and I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I plan to specialize in the field of computer science that deals with machine learning and artificial intelligence development and applications. I have always been interested in things like artificial intelligence as a result of watching things like Star Wars when I was younger. As a result, with the recent rising prominence of artificial intelligence in the current computer science field, I hope to be able to lend my share in terms of artificial intelligence to the industry and find new interesting applications for it in the field especially as there is still a long way to go in creating smarter AI models. Although this AI development may not be as grandiose as Star Wars, I'm still excited at the prospect of being able to develop AI technology!</p>
            <p>Of course, aside from the academic perspective, there are also many other things about me. Growing up in a Vietnamese family, I can understand Vietnamese and can even speak a little. I've been trying to expand my knowledge of reading and writing recently as well. I also have multiple different hobbies with some being more developed than others. One of my main interests is playing guitar. I've been playing guitar for almost 5 years now after picking it up off of the internet. It mostly serves as a way to unwind after a day of work when I attempt to learn new songs. Though I hope to eventually get around to learning music theory so I can start getting better at writing songs of my own! I feel like these kinds of hobbies have helped me greatly throughout my experience so far in computer science through things like giving me a willingness to learn and a drive to practice things until I get better at them.</p>
            <p>Many different interests, experiences, and goals have paved the way for who I am today both professionally and personally. This website offers a little window into who I am in these perspectives so I hope that it leaves a bit of an impression on those who view it. That said, I thank you for viewing the website! Please feel free to take a look at the rest of the pages.</p>

            In terms of my experience and qualifications, I have done multiple coding projects including python game development and JavaFX development. Some of these projects were individual efforts and some were done as part of a development team. For a more in depth look, web pages concerning these are also linked on this web page.
